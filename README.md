## Tech

SOZO uses Googgle Tecnologies :

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs) - Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) -  Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps
- [Android](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?authuser=1) - Mobile Operating System 


## Development

Our inspiration for selecting these specific goals was to make people feel in control of their situation and that they are not alone. 
Be it any kind of help that is needed by the person, a medical emergency, an accident, a vehicle breakdown, a disaster, or any crime incident, help is always on the way. 
We felt like so many crimes and emergencies can be resolved easily if only the person could ask for help and with this application, they finally have a voice. 
You can even help a person near you with the help of this application which alerts all the users and authorities near the person in need for the kind of help needed and volunteers can accept the request for help hence achieving partnership for the goals.

##Challenge 

Our vision is to connect the people stuck in any sort of difficult situations with those who are ready to extend their help. The app serves to bridge and connect the needy with a volunteer in a most efficient way and on a real time basis.
