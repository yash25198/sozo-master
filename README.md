## Tech

## Development

Our inspiration for selecting these specific goals was to make people feel in control of their situation and that they are not alone. 
Be it any kind of help that is needed by the person, a medical emergency, an accident, a vehicle breakdown, a disaster, or any crime incident, help is always on the way. 
We felt like so many crimes and emergencies can be resolved easily if only the person could ask for help and with this application, they finally have a voice. 
You can even help a person near you with the help of this application which alerts all the users and authorities near the person in need for the kind of help needed and volunteers can accept the request for help hence achieving partnership for the goals.
